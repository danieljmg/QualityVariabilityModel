# QualityVariabilityModel
Advanced Reasoning of Quality Valued Configurations in Category Theory

This repository contains the models, operations and results empirically used in [UNDER REVIEW](https://doi.org/) at Journal of Transactions and Software Engineering.
Due to copyright issues, it does not contain the tools (i.e., automated reasoners), although their official sites are provided.

## TSE'24 Models, Categorical Operations and Datasets

This data-set contains:

1. /Models: The 4 SPLs in different formats: .txt and .js for HADAS/Clafer, .uvl for UVLS/Z3 and .cql for QVM/CQL IDE.
2. /QAsCSVs: The corresponding valued variant-wise Quality Attributes for
     a. The complete solution space in 4 large CSVs.
     b. The random sampled solution space in 4 CSVs.
3. A Microsoft Excel file with the scalability results, comparisson, and statistic analyses for non-linear regression approximation functions.
